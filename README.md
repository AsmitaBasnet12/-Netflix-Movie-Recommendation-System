Welcome to the initiative of the Movie Recommendation System! The code for a straightforward Netflix dataset-based movie recommendation system is available in this repository. Based on genres, the system suggests films and offers graphic representations of those recommendations

📂 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
1.Python 3.x
2.Pandas
3.NumPy
4.Scikit-learn
5.Matplotlib
6.Seaborn

Dataset

A Netflix movie dataset is used in the study. Make sure the dataset file is in the project directory, or change the code to point to the right location.


🛠️ How It Works

Data Preprocessing: Cleans the dataset, handles missing values, and performs necessary transformations.

Recommendation Logic: Implements a basic recommendation system based on cosine similarity of genres.
q
Visualization: Generates visualizations to show the recommended movies and their ratings or genres.
